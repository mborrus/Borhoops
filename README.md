#### Dependency Control
I used a virtual env for this, you should do the same so our version match.

`python -m venv ballenvy`
`source ballenvy/bin/activate`
`pip install .`

#### Download the data
Data is held at the kaggle URL. You must log in to download the folder. Set the location of your data folder in the config file. I couldn't be bothered to configure the `kaggle` package.
